# cobaltstrike-malleable-c2-reference
Cobalt Strike Malleable C2 reference profile

# Usage
Do not use the profile as-is - it is just a reference and it will not work without modifications.
To check for errors, use the c2lint utility, that comes with Cobalt Strike.

After that, you can start teamserver with
```bash
./teamserver <your_ip> <password> <path_to_c2_profile>
```
